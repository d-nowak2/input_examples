Examples of using the scanner, functions, and static methods

The following Java source code files provide various examples that range from 
okay to excellent coding principles. 

All Java files can be found in the path: 
input_examples --> src --> edu --> lewisu --> input_examples/

1. ExampleInput.java -- 	This is your basic Java prompting and input 
						demonstration.
							
2. ExampleInputWithFunctions -- This performs the same work as above, but 
								the code is broken up into functions. Further,
								these functions do more work with respect to error-
								and range-checking.
								
3. Main.java and Utils.java --	This is an example of moving much of the code into
								static methods in a separate class. We retain 
								the functionality from above, but add new features 
								via overloaded methods.
